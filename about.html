				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/Headshot.png" class="pr-3" id="headshot">
				<p>I began my career as an engineer at Vanderbilt University. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering Science in 2015.
					Through my course work, I had to take 2 coding classes (Intro to Java and Matlab), but didn't really gain a passion
					for it until I was hired into my first position right out of college. In that position, I did a lot of in XML and transforming
					CSV files, along with some development in a specialized development tool for the software we implement. Through this, I 
					learned I had a knact and passion for coding. From there I pursued some personal study until I joined the Georgia Tech Coding
					Bootcamp where I learned the skills necessary to be a Full Stack Developer. Currently, I am still a senior integrations
					lead for Alight Solutions who was the company that hired me right out of college, but now, I often make website and applications 
					on the side for any who ask.
					
					A few fun facts about myself: I am a diehard Pittsburgh sports fan. Whether it's the Steelers, Penguins, or Pirates, I am always 
					watching a game. I am also a diehard Vanderbilt sports fan. If we field a team in that sport, I watch it. As such, I spend most of 
					my fall lamenting the woes of our football team.</p>
